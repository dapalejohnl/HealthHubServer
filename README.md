# HealthHubServer

Start the server by using the command prompt and typing
```
C:\Users\Usr\Directory Python3 server.py
```

Once running, you can use any browser you'd like to test if the local server is running. You can do so by typing:
```
127.0.0.1/
```
and then press enter to see what is returned! If you get a response, it should say "Hello World!"
